### Abstract

Clinical signs are useful for describing the spectrum of human pathologies. Integrating these phenotypes with single-cell RNA-seq data allows the identification of potential relationships between phenotypes and the specific cell types causing them. In this Master's thesis, single-cell transcriptomic data were used to infer these relationships.Differential expression and co-expression of genes associated with abnormal phenotypes were computed as possible measures to identify the cell types associated with a phenotype. The results obtained by these metrics were compared with the set of phenotype-cell type associations described in the literature. The results showed that co-expression, not so much differential expression, emerges as a measure that allows, on the one hand, to identify significant relationships already present in the literature; and on the other hand, to point out cell types potentially associated with abnormal phenotypes that have not yet been extensively described in the literature.

### Scripts

The following list is exahustive and covers every script on the repo. Feel free to `ctrl+F` to the specific scripts you are interested in.

---

- `HPA/extract-dataset.sh`: Bash script for dividing the HPA dataset according to the tissues. It is used from the command line as follows:

```bash
./extract-dataset.sh tissue last-cluster
```

```bash
Rscript COTAN-cluster-script.R tissue-cluster
```

Being tissue-cluster the combination of the tissue name and the cluster name (e.g. liver-0). It reads the RDS file with the `scCOTAN` object already preprocessed and outputs another RDS file with the co-expression matrix.

---

- `HPA/results/run_cluster_script.sh`: Bash script for running `COTAN-cluster-script.R` for each cluster of a given tissue. It is used from the command line as follows:

```bash

```bash
python3 annotation-files.py
```

It takes Uberon child terms, Uberon-HPO relationships, HPO-genes relationships and the HPO OBO file (for HPO children terms) and generates two TSV files: the first one has the structure tissue **`\t`** HPO code **\t** HPO name **\t** num genes; and the second one has the structure HPO code **\t** gene code **\t** gene name.

---

- `annotations/specific-annotation-file.py`: Python script for filtering the first output file of `annotation-files.py` to keep only HPO terms with 20 or more associated genes that do not have any children term with 20 or more associated genes. It is used from the command line as follows:

```bash
python3 specific-annotation-file.py
```

It takes output file 1 from `annotation-files.py` and the HPO OBO file, and generates a filtered TSV file with the same format.

---

- `annotations/HPO/ENSEMBL-to-Entrez-id.py`: Python script for obtaining Entrez ID- Ensembl ID relationships for HPA genes. It is used from the comand line as follows:

```bash
python3 ENSEMBL-to-Entrez-id.py
```

It takes HPA genes Ensembl IDs and Ensembl-Entrez relationships retrieved from BioMart, and generates two JSON files: the first file with the Ensembl IDs as keys and the Entrez IDs as the content of the entries, and the second file the other way around.

---

- `annotations/HPO/HPO-UBERON.py`: Python script for generating HPO-Uberon relationships. It is used from the command line as follows:

```bash
python3 HPO-UBERON.py
```

It takes the HPO OWL file and generates two JSON files: the first file with the HPO terms as keys and the Uberon terms as the content of the entries, and the second file the other way around.

---

- `annotations/HPO/entrez-HPO.py`: Python script for generating HPO-genes relationships. It is used from the command line as follows:

```bash
python3 entrez-HPO.py
```

It takes Ensembl-Entrez relationships and HPO annotation file and generates a JSON file with the HPO terms as keys and the gene Entrez ID, Ensembl ID and regular name as the content of the entries.

---

- `annotations/HPO/hpo-id-to-name.py`: Python script for having an easy access to HPO terms names. It is used from the command line as follows:

```bash
python3 hpo-is-to-name.py
```

It takes the HPO OBO file and generates the file hpo-id-to-name, with the format HPO code **\t** HPO name.

---

- `annotations/UBERON/children-terms.py`: Python script for obtaining children terms of Uberon terms (or any ontology). It is used inside `run-children-terms.sh` as follows:

```bash
python3 children-terms.py OBO tissue
```

Being `OBO` the ontology OBO file (Uberon in this case) and `tissue` the term whose childs we want to retrieve (in this case the name of an Uberon term). The output is printed direclty to the console and it has the structure UBERON term **\t** term name **\t** UBERON subterm **\t** subterm name **\t** relationship.

---

- `annotations/UBERON/run-children-terms.sh`: Bash script for running `children-terms.py` for all tissues in HPA and redirecting the output to actual files. It is used from the command line as follows:
