### Abstract

Clinical signs are useful for describing the spectrum of human pathologies. Integrating these phenotypes with single-cell RNA-seq data allows the identification of potential relationships between phenotypes and the specific cell types causing them. In this Master’s thesis, single-cell transcriptomic data were used to infer these relationships. We computed the differential expression and co-expression of genes associated with abnormal phenotypes, and analyzed whether their values were significantly different by studying various metrics that assessed the existence of scientific literature concerning each specific relationship. The results showed that co-expression, not so much differential expression, emerges as a measure that allows, on the one hand, to identify significant relationships already present in the literature; and on the other hand, to point out cell types potentially associated with abnormal phenotypes that have not yet been extensively described in the literature.
