### Abstract

Clinical signs are useful for describing the spectrum of human pathologies. Integrating these phenotypes with single-cell RNA-seq data allows the identification of potential relationships between phenotypes and the specific cell types causing them. In this Master's thesis, single-cell transcriptomic data were used to infer these relationships.Differential expression and co-expression of genes associated with abnormal phenotypes were computed as possible measures to identify the cell types associated with a phenotype. The results obtained by these metrics were compared with the set of phenotype-cell type associations described in the literature. The results showed that co-expression, not so much differential expression, emerges as a measure that allows, on the one hand, to identify significant relationships already present in the literature; and on the other hand, to point out cell types potentially associated with abnormal phenotypes that have not yet been extensively described in the literature.
